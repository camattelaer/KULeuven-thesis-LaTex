\chapter{Document structure} \label{intro:chap}

\section{This is a section}

\subsection{This is a subsection} 

\subsubsection{this is a subsubsection}

Here you can see all used layers of titles. I decided to remove numbering starting from \verb=\subsubsection= and use a symbol. \verb=paragraph= is also not numbered and the body follows inline. I personally advise not to use numbered structures too much to prevent numbers like 1.1.1.1.1 which for me just feels unreadable. 

All formatting of all section titles is found in the \verb=memoir.config= file and can be adjusted to your taste.

\section{References}

Each chapter is required to have a list of references. This is accomplished using the \verb=refsection= environment. Each \verb=refsection= environment can use its own \verb=.bib= file.

\section{additional configuration}

For other content, e.g. floats and references, the packages can also be found in \verb=memoir.config=. If you need extra advice on how to use or configure them, please look in their respective documentation online. If you can't find a solution, you can always reach out but depending on the impact of your request i might or might not be able to help.
