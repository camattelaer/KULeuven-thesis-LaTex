# KULeuven-thesis-LaTex
A LaTex template for a Master's or PhD thesis using KULeuven (Belgium) colorscheme

# Template
I will add a minimal working example (MWE) in the coming days that illustrates the main components and look of the template.

You are free to use this template, but an acknowledgement is always appreciated.

# Example 
My PhD thesis is added as a complete example of how this template looks. 

Due to the high resolution images used in the compiled thesis, the size of the original file is quite large (approx. 130 MB). The document available here is a compressed version. The original thesis (high resolution images) is freely available from the KULeuven database (https://lirias.kuleuven.be/3549020?limo=0).
